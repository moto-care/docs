When it comes to storing passwords securely, choosing the right hashing algorithm is crucial to protect against various types of attacks such as brute-force and rainbow table attacks. The ideal password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow and resource-intensive, making it difficult for attackers to crack passwords even with powerful hardware.

Here are the best hashing algorithms recommended for password storage:
1. Argon2

Overview:
Argon2 is currently considered the most secure and robust password hashing algorithm. It won the Password Hashing Competition (PHC) in 2015 and has since been widely adopted.

Features:

    Memory-hard Function: Designed to use a significant amount of memory to hinder parallel processing attacks.
    Configurable Parameters: Allows adjustment of memory usage, execution time, and degree of parallelism to balance between security and performance.
    Variants:
        Argon2i: Optimized for resistance against side-channel attacks.
        Argon2d: Optimized for resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
        Argon2id: A hybrid version that combines the features of Argon2i and Argon2d, providing balanced protection.

Implementation:
Argon2 is widely supported in various programming languages and frameworks. It is recommended to use Argon2id for most applications due to its balanced security features.

Example Libraries:

    Python: argon2-cffi
    Node.js: argon2
    Java: argon2-jvm

2. bcrypt

Overview:
bcrypt is a popular and time-tested password hashing algorithm that has been in use since 1999. It is still considered secure for most applications.

Features:

    Adaptive Hashing: Allows increasing the iteration count to make it slower as computing power increases.
    Built-in Salt: Automatically generates and stores a salt alongside the hashed password.
    Resistant to Rainbow Table Attacks: Due to its use of salts and slow computation.

Implementation:
bcrypt is supported across many platforms and languages, making it a convenient choice.

Example Libraries:

    Python: bcrypt
    Node.js: bcrypt
    Java: jBCrypt

3. scrypt

Overview:
scrypt is designed to be more memory-intensive than bcrypt, making it more resistant to hardware brute-force attacks, especially those using GPUs and ASICs.

Features:

    Memory-hard Function: Requires a large amount of memory to compute, making parallel attacks costly.
    Configurable Parameters: You can adjust CPU cost, memory cost, and parallelization parameters.
    Built-in Salt: Incorporates salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.

Implementation:
scrypt is also widely supported but may have slower performance compared to bcrypt and Argon2 depending on the settings.

Example Libraries:

    Python: pyscrypt
    Node.js: scrypt
    Java: Scrypt

4. PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)

Overview:
PBKDF2 is an older algorithm standardized by NIST. While not as robust as the above options, it is still considered secure when used with a high iteration count.

Features:

    Adaptive Function: Allows setting a high number of iterations to increase computation time.
    Salted Hashing: Requires a unique salt for each password.
    Widely Supported: Available in many standard libraries and frameworks.

Implementation:
Due to its wide support, PBKDF2 can be a fallback option when other algorithms are not available.

Example Libraries:

    Python: hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac
    Node.js: crypto.pbkdf2
    Java: SecretKeyFactory

Best Practices for Using Password Hashing Algorithms

Regardless of the algorithm you choose, follow these best practices to ensure maximum security:
1. Use Unique Salts

Always generate a unique, random salt for each password. This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.
2. Configure Appropriate Parameters

Adjust the algorithm's parameters (such as iteration count, memory usage, and parallelism) to make hashing computationally intensive, but still acceptable for user experience.
3. Regularly Update Parameters

As hardware becomes more powerful, periodically increase the computational cost parameters to maintain security.
4. Secure Storage

Store only the salted and hashed passwords. Never store plaintext passwords or reversible encrypted passwords.
5. Monitor and Update Algorithms

Stay informed about advancements in cryptography and update your hashing algorithms accordingly to protect against new types of attacks.
Conclusion

For new applications, Argon2id is currently the recommended algorithm due to its robustness and flexibility. However, bcrypt and scrypt are also acceptable choices and have proven security track records. Always ensure that you implement these algorithms correctly and follow best practices to maintain the security of user passwords.
